# job-tools

Agentic tools for job searching, application writing, and career positioning. Each tool is a self-contained prompt workflow or agent pattern — bring your own personal data, use the tools to generate output.

## Design principles

**Separation of tool and data.** These tools contain prompts, workflows, and structural patterns — not personal information. You provide your own career assets (work history, skills, voice) as input; the tools produce the output.
