# Writing Style Wizard

A guided conversation to capture your natural writing voice.
Output: `writing-style.md` — a voice profile the cover-letter-generator uses
to keep every letter sounding like you.

Run this even if you've used the PDF parser. The wizard adds what letters can't show:
how you *want* to come across, not just how you have.

**How to use:**
1. Copy everything below the line
2. Paste into Claude
3. Answer the questions — as much or as little detail as you have
4. Ask Claude to generate `writing-style.md` when done

You are helping me capture my natural writing voice so that AI-generated cover letters
sound like me, not like a template.

Work through the sections below. Ask follow-up questions where my answers are thin.
When we've covered enough ground, generate a `writing-style.md` file.

---

## SECTION 1: Voice and tone

Ask me:

1. If a colleague read my cover letter without knowing I wrote it, what three adjectives
   would they use to describe the writing style? And what three would they *not* use?

2. On a spectrum from "formal and polished" to "conversational and direct" — where do I
   naturally sit? Where do I *want* to sit?

3. Am I more comfortable leading with logic ("here's the evidence") or with feeling
   ("here's why this matters to me")?

4. Do I find it easy to write confidently about myself, or do I tend to hedge?
   (e.g. "I believe I could bring..." vs "I bring...")

## SECTION 2: Writing samples

Ask me to share:

1. Paste 1-3 paragraphs from any writing I'm proud of — doesn't have to be a cover letter.
   Could be an email, a proposal, a LinkedIn post, a piece of work documentation.
   The goal is to capture voice, not context.

2. Is there a writer, columnist, or communicator whose style I admire?
   What specifically do I like about how they write?

3. Paste a sentence or two I've written that I think captures me at my best.

Analyse the samples for: sentence length, vocabulary level, rhythm, use of "I",
confidence level, whether they lead with claim or context.

## SECTION 3: What to avoid

Ask me:

1. What phrases make me cringe in cover letters — mine or others'?
   (Prompt with examples if needed: "I am passionate about...", "team player",
   "proven track record", "I am writing to express my interest in...")

2. What tone feels wrong for me? (Too corporate? Too casual? Too self-deprecating?
   Too salesy?)

3. Is there anything I always want to avoid mentioning or framing a certain way?

---

## SECTION 4: Structural preferences

Ask me:

1. Do I prefer flowing paragraphs, or do I like some visual structure (bullets, headers)?

2. How do I feel about opening with a bold claim vs easing in with context?
   Which feels more natural when I write?

3. How do I like to close? (Assertive and forward-looking? Warm and appreciative?
   Minimal — just sign off?)

4. Do I like to mention specific things about the company, or does that feel forced?
   If yes, what kind of specificity feels genuine to me?

---

## SECTION 5: Phrases I want to use

Ask me:

1. Are there phrases or sentence structures I gravitate toward that feel authentically mine?

2. Any words or expressions I particularly like?

3. Any lines from cover letters I've written (or seen) that I'd happily use again?

Capture a shortlist of 5-10 phrases to seed the phrase library.

## Generating writing-style.md

When we've covered the sections above, generate a `writing-style.md` with:

**Voice summary**
2-3 sentences: what my writing sounds like and aims to feel like.
(e.g. "Direct and evidence-led, with warmth underneath. Short sentences. Confident
first person. No hedging, no jargon. Reads like a smart colleague talking, not a template.")

**Tone profile**
- Formality: [1-5 scale, 1=very casual, 5=very formal] + description
- Confidence: [1-5] + description
- Warmth: [1-5] + description
- Structure preference: prose / structured / hybrid

**Sentence rhythm**
- Typical sentence length: short / mixed / long
- Paragraph length: tight (2-3 sentences) / standard (3-5) / expansive
- Any rhythm patterns to replicate

**Vocabulary**
- Words and phrases to use freely
- Words and phrases to avoid entirely
- Register: plain / professional / elevated

**Opening guidance**
What works for me when starting a cover letter. Include 1-2 example opening lines.

**Closing guidance**
What works for me when closing. Include 1-2 example closing lines.

**Voice examples**
3-5 sentences extracted or derived from our conversation that exemplify my best voice.
These are reference points for the cover-letter-generator.

**Red flags**
5-10 specific phrases or patterns to never use in my cover letters.
