# Quick Add Prompt

For when you have a raw thought — a skill you just realised you have, something you shipped,
a win, a new way you described yourself that landed well — and want to capture it before it's gone.

No need to format it yourself. Drop the thought here, Claude figures out where it goes.

**How to use:**
1. Copy everything below the line
2. Paste into Claude followed by your raw thought
3. Claude tells you exactly what to add and where
4. Copy the formatted entry into the right asset file

I'm maintaining a career asset library for job applications. It has five files:
- `work_experience.md` — career history with role IDs
- `capabilities.md` — searchable capability and accomplishment database (tagged, cross-referenced)
- `competency_clusters.md` — skill groupings with job-ad trigger keywords
- `qualities_workstyle.md` — working style and personal attributes
- `profiles.md` — positioning statements

Here is a raw thought I want to capture:

[YOUR RAW THOUGHT HERE — e.g. "I just realised I'm actually pretty good at running
structured retrospectives — we did one last week and it surfaced three blockers the
team hadn't been able to name for months" or "we shipped the new pricing engine today,
it handles 4x the transaction volume and we did it in 6 weeks"]

---

Based on this, do the following:

1. **Identify which file(s) this belongs to** — could be one or multiple
2. **Format the entry** in the exact structure of that file:
   - For capabilities.md: Title / Type / Description / Evidence+Metrics / Tags / Role / Clusters
   - For qualities_workstyle.md: the relevant section and bullet points
   - For competency_clusters.md: if this reveals a new cluster or strengthens an existing one's trigger keywords
3. **Suggest tags** that match job ad language, not internal jargon
4. **Suggest a role reference** (ask me which role this comes from if unclear)
5. **Suggest cluster references** (from competency_clusters.md if known)

Output a ready-to-paste block for each file it touches, with clear instructions:
"Add this to capabilities.md under [Category]" or "Add this bullet to qualities_workstyle.md under [Section]".

If the thought is vague or missing a metric, ask one targeted follow-up question before formatting:
"Do you have a number for this? Even approximate — '~3 months faster', 'about 40% less back-and-forth'?"
