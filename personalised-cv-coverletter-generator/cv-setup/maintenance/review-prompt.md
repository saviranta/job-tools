# Asset Review Prompt

Use this periodically — every quarter or before a job search — to audit your asset files
and surface gaps, weak spots, and opportunities to strengthen your positioning.

**How to use:**
1. Copy everything below the line
2. Paste into Claude along with the contents of all five asset files
3. Claude audits the files and returns a prioritised list of gaps and recommendations
4. Work through the suggestions in order of impact

I'm maintaining a career asset library for job applications. It has five files:
- `work_experience.md` — career history with role IDs
- `capabilities.md` — searchable capability and accomplishment database (tagged, cross-referenced)
- `competency_clusters.md` — skill groupings with job-ad trigger keywords
- `qualities_workstyle.md` — working style and personal attributes
- `profiles.md` — positioning statements

Here are the current contents of my asset files:

[PASTE work_experience.md CONTENTS HERE]

[PASTE capabilities.md CONTENTS HERE]

[PASTE competency_clusters.md CONTENTS HERE]

[PASTE qualities_workstyle.md CONTENTS HERE]

[PASTE profiles.md CONTENTS HERE]

Please audit these files and return the following:

**1. Coverage gaps**
- Which roles in `work_experience.md` have few or no capabilities linked to them?
- Which competency clusters have thin evidence (fewer than 2-3 capabilities pointing to them)?
- Are there `<!-- FILL IN -->` placeholders that should be completed?

**2. Evidence quality**
- Which capabilities are missing metrics or specific outcomes? Flag them individually.
- Which entries use vague language ("improved", "led", "drove") without proof?
- Are there capabilities with no role reference or cluster tag?

**3. Tag and keyword gaps**
- Are there clusters with fewer than 5 trigger keywords? Suggest additions.
- Are there capabilities whose tags don't match modern job ad language?
- Are there common job ad terms (OKR, GTM, stakeholder management, etc.) that aren't covered?

**4. Positioning coherence**
- Do the profiles in `profiles.md` align with the strongest evidence in `capabilities.md`?
- Is the strongest cluster well-evidenced and clearly positioned?
- Are there contradictions between how you're positioned and what the evidence supports?

**5. Prioritised recommendations**
Return a numbered list, most impactful first:
- What to add (with suggested format, ready to paste)
- What to strengthen (with a specific follow-up question to unlock the metric or detail)
- What to rewrite (with a suggested improved version)

Keep suggestions actionable — not "add more metrics" but "this entry needs a number: how long did the rollout take? How many teams were involved?"
