# Qualities & Work Style

<!--
PURPOSE: Your personal attributes, working philosophy, and leadership approach.
This file is used to give cover letters and profile statements an authentic voice —
it's what makes your application sound like you rather than a generic candidate.

HOW DOWNSTREAM TOOLS USE THIS FILE:
- cover-letter-generator draws on this for tone, framing, and personal voice
- cv-generator uses this for profile/summary sections
- job-listing-analyzer cross-references this when identifying cultural fit signals

TIPS:
- Write in first person, present tense
- Be specific — "I communicate directly and adjust depth by audience" beats "good communicator"
- Concrete examples are more powerful than abstract claims
- It's okay if this sounds personal — that's the point
-->
