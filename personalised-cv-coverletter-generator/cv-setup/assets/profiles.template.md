# Profile Statements

<!--
PURPOSE: Pre-written positioning statements for different target contexts.
Rather than writing your profile from scratch each time, you maintain
a library of statements tuned to different audiences and roles.
The cv-generator selects and adapts the most relevant one.

HOW DOWNSTREAM TOOLS USE THIS FILE:
- cv-generator picks the closest matching profile and adapts it to the specific role
- cover-letter-generator uses the positioning logic to open cover letters
- job-listing-analyzer checks which profile context best fits a given role

TIPS:
- Write one profile per distinct target context (not per company)
- 3-5 sentences is the right length for a CV profile
- Lead with your current level and domain, end with what you're moving towards
- Avoid generic phrases ("passionate", "results-driven") — use specific claims
- Update these when your targets or positioning shifts, not per application

<!--
Add more profiles as your target landscape shifts.
A good rule of thumb: if you're applying to a meaningfully different
type of role or company, you probably need a new profile entry.
